Flask == 1.1.1
python 3.7.1
This application is a python flask application developed initially to be used as adatabase tool and system for a church
so it simply handles basic database operations like inserting, updating, deleting etc.
It is  built upon both flask sqlalchemy and flask, so some of the queries are handled by Flask_sqlalchemy APi where as some are simply written as raw SQL statements being supported by flask in querying the database
Alot of the Flask and flask_sqlalchmey implementations are presented by this app and one can still use it for learning but also can use it for their own project building
Bootstrap is used for the frontend and also the fontend is not yet complete just to mean this project ins still under development but its backend is totally free of any errors,
So if you Know how to use the basic routing system of Flask, then i guess you are good to check out the functionality os this applicayion
This application makes use of two database connections, one is found in the finalapp.cfg file and another is found in the main2.py file, one for sqlalchemy and another for the basic raw database handling with flask.
Mysql is the database used for this application though the settings can be edited to fit your preffered database system 
After creating the various configurations you can now begin to have fun with the now available bakend of the Kyambogo SDA database management system.
